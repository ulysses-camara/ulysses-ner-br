abstract="The amount of legislative documents produced within the past decade has risen dramatically, making it difficult for law practitioners to consult and update legislation. Named Entity Recognition (NER) systems have the untapped potential to extract information from legal documents, which can improve information retrieval and decision-making processes. We introduce the UlyssesNER-Br, a corpus of Brazilian Legislative Documents for NER with quality baselines. The presented corpus consists of bills and legislative consultations from Brazilian Chamber of Deputies. We implemented Conditional Random Field (CRF) and Hidden Markov Model (HMM) models, and the promising F1-score of 80.8{\%} in the analysis by categories and 81.04{\%} in the analysis by types, was achieved with the CRF model. The entities with the best average F1-score results were ``FUNDlei'' and ``DATA'', and the ones with the worst results were ``EVENTO'' and ``PESSOAgrupoind''. The corpus was also evaluated using a BiLSTM-CRF and Glove architectures provided by the pioneering state-of-the-art paper, achieving F1-score of 76.89{\%} in the analysis by categories and 59.67{\%} in the analysis by types.",

abstract="Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a challenging Natural Language Processing task for a language as rich as Portuguese. When applied in a scenario appropriate to informal language and short texts, the task acquires a new layer of complexity, handling a particular lexicon to the domain in question. In this paper, we expanded the UlyssesNER-Br corpus for NER task with Brazilian Portuguese comments about bills. Additionally, we enriched the annotated set with a formal corpora, in order to analyze whether the combination of formal and informal texts from the same domain could improve NER. Finally, we carry out experiments with a Conditional Random Fields (CRF) model, a Bidirectional LSTM-CRF (BiLSTM-CRF) model, and subsequently, we realized fine-tuning of a language model BERT on NER task with our dataset. We concluded that formal texts helped identification of entities in informal texts. The best model was the fine-tuned BERT which achieved an F1-score of 73.90{\%}, beating the benchmark of related works.",
